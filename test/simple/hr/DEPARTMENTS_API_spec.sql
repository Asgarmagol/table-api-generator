  This API provides DML functionality that can be easily called from APEX.
  Target of the table API is to encapsulate the table DML source code for
  security (UI schema needs only the execute right for the API and the
  read/write right for the DEPARTMENTS_DML_V, tables can be
  hidden in extra data schema) and easy readability of the business logic
  (all DML is then written in the same style). For APEX automatic row
  processing like tabular forms you can optionally use the
  DEPARTMENTS_DML_V. The instead of trigger for this view
  is calling simply this "DEPARTMENTS_API".
